    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Built WorkflowUI, a schema-driven rendering engine and Guided Workflows platform used across Amazon HR for life events and employee journeys.</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>HR experiences were fragmented and inconsistent across systems; accessibility, localization, and observability were required for global scale.</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Designed and implemented a schema-driven UI engine with Guided Workflows, built monitoring/CDK templates, and coordinated security/privacy readiness.</p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Platform adopted across Amazon HR, supporting 1.5M+ employees.</li>
      <li>Delivered Life Events and other high-impact experiences with accessibility and localization compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical deep dive</h3>
    <p>Implemented rendering engine components in TypeScript/React, built data pipelines and monitoring dashboards (CloudWatch/CDK), and created developer tooling to onboard teams.</p>

    <h3>Role</h3>
    <p>Led development for WorkflowUI and Guided Workflows, authored runbooks and onboarding guides, and mentored engineers.</p>

    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <p>Java, TypeScript, React, DynamoDB, ECS, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudWatch, CDK, Spark SQL, Redshift, S3, Athena</p>
