    <h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2>
    <p>Delivered the UI for the in-console CloudWatch Agent management experience enabling guided installation and configuration with automatically detected recommendations across 16 AWS regions.</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Agent setup was slow and error-prone: customers took hours to configure agents across fleets; monitoring and performance visibility were limited.</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Built an in-console guided workflow with automatic recommendations, tuned backend concurrency and retries, and restored telemetry pipelines to ensure reliable dashboards.</p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced agent setup time from ~4.7 hours to under 5 minutes (~98% improvement).</li>
      <li>Improved status table load times from ~25–29s to 8–12s for large fleets.</li>
      <li>Restored performance dashboards and increased telemetry reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical deep dive</h3>
    <p>Worked across frontend (TypeScript + React), backend services, and infra (CDK, Lambda). Tuned concurrency and retry buffering, increased log event limits, fixed ingestion/backfill paths, and added end-to-end test coverage.</p>

    <h3>Role</h3>
    <p>Lead development of the in-console UI, performance tuning, test improvements, and on-call support for production releases.</p>

    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <p>Go, Java, TypeScript, React, CloudWatch, SSM, CDK, Lambda, EC2, EKS, DynamoDB, Terraform, Playwright, GitHub Actions, EC2 Image Builder, OpenTelemetry (OpAMP)</p>
